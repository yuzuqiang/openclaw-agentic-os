# OpenClaw Agentic OS

Production-oriented control-plane design and implementation workspace for OpenClaw's Agentic OS workflows.

## Current status

The initial design artifact passed dual independent design acceptance. The
current corrected design artifact has **not** yet passed fresh independent
revalidation, and neither artifact proves production runtime behavior.

- Design: [`docs/agentic-os-production-adaptation.md`](docs/agentic-os-production-adaptation.md)
- Last independently accepted design artifact SHA-256: `fdbc432dc8ce7bcbc5ced08291503bbd171417fe63217a2b565f5ae31c0f458d`
- Current design artifact SHA-256: `01fb7c282ac8339c83ae4161921c80dd52692066e65e150a3a8b8a021e744f94`
- Base DDL migration SHA-256: `2a06f894952629523a4c1671148ce47dd7345a2340128713143fdff904486a01`
- Current latest migration SHA-256: `44cada46292f8f631e06621267321792428a6289ec15ebdf7be4146de237d36e`
- Current migration manifest SHA-256: `532a9fadcb3990f049df53bc88f41663487d6526837d01f4da3378cfd72224a5`
- Design contract: 27 baseline SQLite tables plus one compatibility archive table, 30 executable SLO queries
- Remaining implementation scope: P0/P1 schema, adapters, reconciler, predicate runner, crash fixtures, rollback drills, and production smoke tests

The current P0 foundation materializes the corrected schema and supplies
fail-closed privacy and external-metadata probes. Database authority remains
disabled (`agentic_os.DB_AUTHORITY_ENABLED is False`), and no OpenClaw runtime
adapter is implemented yet.

## Foundation commands

The package has no runtime dependencies outside Python's standard library.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m agentic_os.cli preflight
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m agentic_os.cli migrate --test-db
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m agentic_os.cli shadow-backfill --db state/agentic-os/test-control.db --workflow heartbeat --run-id shadow-demo --artifact README.md
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m agentic_os.cli shadow-audit --db state/agentic-os/test-control.db --workflow heartbeat --run-id shadow-demo --prepare-idempotency-key file-shadow:shadow-demo --artifact README.md
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m agentic_os.cli verify --db state/agentic-os/offline-snapshot.db
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

`migrate --test-db` is also available for a deliberately ignored repo-local
test database. Tests use temporary directories and never create
`state/agentic-os/control.db`.

`shadow-backfill` and `shadow-audit` are offline P0.2 tools. They project only
explicit file artifacts into `file_authority_shadow` rows and compare current
file hashes, prepare identity, workflow mode, and deterministic projection IDs
back to those rows; they do not enable database authority or feed dispatch
decisions.

The first P1.0 executable budget fixture pack lives under
`tests/fixtures/budgets/` plus `tests/fixtures/sqlite_type_affinity_h1_h4.sql`.
`MigrationTests.test_p1_budget_sql_fixture_pack_exercises_blocking_slos`
applies each fixture to a fresh migrated database and proves the expected
blocking SLO query fires.

`verify` accepts only an offline, checkpointed SQLite snapshot. It fails closed
if a sibling `-wal`, `-shm`, or `-journal` file exists; use SQLite's backup API
to produce the snapshot instead of copying a live database file.

The packaging/retrieval boundary must call
`agentic_os.privacy.assert_paths_retrievable`. Raw databases, WAL/SHM files,
SQLite files, dot-suffixed database copies, and backup trees are denied unless
an explicit local-recovery caller opts in. External session and allow-lease
integrations must pass the
validators in `agentic_os.metadata`; these validators are probes, not runtime
integration proof.

## Version-management policy

- `main` contains reviewed project state.
- Implementation work should use focused branches and pull requests.
- Every PR must wait for a completed GitHub Codex review; any P0/P1 finding blocks merge.
- After Codex is clean, River performs the final audit and merges into `main`.
- Design changes must preserve executable DDL/SLO validation and adversarial fixtures.
- Production readiness must be backed by runtime evidence, not document-only acceptance.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the enforced review workflow and review guidance.
